/**
 * Top-level DSL extension for the `io.qalipsis.build` plugin, exposed as `qalipsisBuild { ... }`
 * in `build.gradle.kts`.
 *
 * Each feature of the plugin is configured through a dedicated nested extension. Currently the
 * only feature is [metricsReport]; additional features can be added here in the future.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * qalipsisBuild {
 *     metricsReport {
 *         enabled.set(true)
 *         prefixOverrides.put("MyStep.redisMethod", "scan")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
